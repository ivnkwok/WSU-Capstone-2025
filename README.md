# Votegrity

This project is a drag and drop pdf creator that allows for streamlined election document creation while also being flexible enough accommodate for any document type. While this is like Google Docs or Microsoft Word, it is more restrictive so that eventually, outside election administrators will be able to create and format their own election documents while conforming to Votegrityâ€™s document style. Google Docs and Microsoft Word are both very powerful document creators, and while they are currently used, they are not the ideal solution due to the absolute freedom they provide to the document creator.
